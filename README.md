#React From Scratch

I have included basically all the bare essentials to make a full fledged web app.

##Quick Start
If you have not done so already you should probably go grab a copy of nodejs.

Fork or Clone this repo.

Copy this structure into a new folder on your computer

run `npm install -g webpack`

run `npm install` 

run `webpack` to build the bundle and open index.html to see the result.

Make an awesome app.

Have fun!

##Background
I got tired of having to remake this structure. So I decided to make a stipped down
app with virtually nothing in it that I can use to jumpstart any webapp I want to work on.
