# React From Scratch

This package includes all the bare essentials to make a full fledged web app.

## Quick Start
If you have not done so already you should probably go grab a copy of nodejs.

Fork or Clone this repo.
Copy this structure into a new folder on your computer
run `npm install` to setup the required node modules
run `npm run build` to build the bundle with webpack 
Now you should be able to open index.html to see the result.

Have fun!

## Development Pro Tip
There is a webpack-dev-server setup for you as well. So if you run `npm run dev`
a webpack-dev-server will start on port 3000 and you can access it from <http://localhost:3000>

This will let you live develop your site.

## More Info and Docs
Here are some very useful docs and reasources for ReactJS and other technologies in this archive.

## Background
I got tired of having to remake this react structure. So I decided to make a stipped down
app with virtually nothing in it that I can use to jumpstart any webapp I want to work on.
